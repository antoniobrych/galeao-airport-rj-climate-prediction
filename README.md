# Gale√£o Airport RJ Climate Prediction with RNN

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict climate conditions at Gala Airport (SBGL) using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The goal is to leverage historical weather data to forecast future climate conditions. The project is implemented using Jupyter Notebooks and demonstrates the application of RNN models for time-series forecasting.

## Files Included

- **`SBGL_Prediction.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the implementation of the RNN model used for climate prediction. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

- **`SBGL_Weather_DATA.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook provides an overview of the dataset used in the project. It includes data loading, exploration, and preprocessing steps.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is too large to upload directly to GitHub. Instead, you can download the dataset from Kaggle using the following link:

- [Download SBGL Climate Data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antoniobrych/25-years-of-hourly-weather-history-rio-de-janeiro)

After downloading, please place the dataset files in the appropriate directory as specified in the Jupyter Notebooks.

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebooks, ensure you have the following packages installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter tensorflow pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
